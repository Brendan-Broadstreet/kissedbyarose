                        You became the light on the dark side of me
                        Love remained a drug that's the high and not the pill
                        But did you know that when it snows
                        My eyes become large and the light that you shine can be seen?
                        Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the grey
                        Ooh, the more I get of you, the stranger it feels, yeah
                        Now that your rose is in bloom
                        A light hits the gloom on the grey
                        There is so much a man can tell you, so much he can say
                        You remain my power, my pleasure, my pain
                        Baby, to me, you're like a growing addiction that I can't deny
                        Won't you tell me, is that healthy, baby?
                        But did you know that when it snows
                        My eyes become large and the light that you shine can be seen?
                        Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the grey
                        Ooh, the more I get of you, the stranger it feels, yeah
                        Now that your rose is in bloom
                        A light hits the gloom on the grey
                        I've been kissed by a rose on the grey
                        I've been kissed by a rose on the grey
                        And if I should fall, will it all go away?
                        I've been kissed by a rose on the grey
                        There is so much a man can tell you, so much he can say
                        You remain my power, my pleasure, my pain
                        To me, you're like a growing, addiction that I can't deny
